		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>Indianapolis, Indiana is the home of the Indianapolis <a href="./index.html">Colts</a> and the capital of Indiana.  Also known as "The Crossroads of America," Indianapolis sits at the intersection of a large number of interstate highways.  As of 2020, Indianapolis had a population of 887,642, and covered a total of 367.93 square miles.  Indianapolis was founded in 1820, but did not begin growing in a significant manner until the Civil War, where Indianapolis served as a major logistics hub.  Indianapolis falls in the Eastern Time Zone.  Most interestingly, Indianapolis's downtown area is formed like a typical grid, but with an X running through the grid to facilitate traffic directly to the circle at the center of Indianapolis containing the Soldiers and Sailor's Monument.
