		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>One of the best <a href="./index.html">Colts</a> players, and players in the broader NFL, Peyton Manning consistently let the <a href="./index.html">Colts</a> to the playoffs.  First drafted by the <a href="./index.html">Colts</a> with the first pick of the 1998 draft as a quarterback, Manning intially struggled on the field.  His first season, Manning set a new league record for most interceptions (28).  However, as the <a href="./index.html">Colts</a> began to build around Manning, his talent as a pocket passer began to show through.		
		<h3>Colts Tenure</h3>
		<p>Throughout Manning's stint with the <a href="./index.html">Colts</a> from the 1999-2010 seasons, the <a href="./index.html">Colts</a> only missed the playoffs a single time in 2001.  In 2010, Peyton Manning suffered a catastrophic neck injury that led to his abstaining from the 2011 season.  This led to a catastrophic performance in the 2011 season, and the <a href="./index.html">Colts</a> drafted Andrew Luck following the season as a new quarterback.  The <a href="./index.html">Colts</a> simultaneously parted ways with Peyton Manning, who went to the Denver Broncos for another four seasons and another Super Bowl victory.  Manning's split with the <a href="./index.html">Colts</a> is oft referenced during the current spat between <a href="./index.html">Colts</a> owner Jim Irsay and running back <a href="./jt.html">Jonathan Taylor</a>.
