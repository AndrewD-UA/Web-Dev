		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>Jonathan Taylor is a running back for the <a href="./location.html">Indianapolis</a> <a href="./index.html">Colts</a>, an NFL team.  Jonathan Taylor started as a running back at the University of Wisconsin, where he was widely respected, won multiple awards, and set school records.  Jonathan Taylor was drafted with the 41st pick in the 2020 NFL draft by the Indianapolis Colts, where he has played since.  Jonathan Taylor was initially drafted as a backup to Marlon Mack.</p>
		<h3>Professional Performance</h3>
		<p>Jonathan Taylor has mostly performed admirably throughout his first three seasons.  After Marlon Mack suffered an injury in the 2020 season, Taylor filled in as the starter for the remainder of the season.  Taylor is widely considered to have had his NFL breakout in the second half of the season, where his performance placed him at 3rd overall for NFL rushing yards that season.  Taylor went on in 2021 to completely dominate the ground game, finishing the season hundreds of yards ahead of the second-place NFL rusher Nick Chubb.  However, Taylor's 2022 season was riddled with injury, which combined with the complete collapse of the Colts offensive line to prevent Taylor from performing notably.  Taylor is often compared to <a href="./manning.html">Manning</a>-era running back Edgerrin James, who's rushing yards record was broken by Taylor in the 2021 season.</p>
		<h3>Controversy</h3>
		<p>In the 2023 offseason, running backs across the NFL began pushing for better pay due to their outsize risk of injury and NFL team's willingness to replace them easily.  Simultaneously, Taylor pushed the Colts to sign him with a large second contract despite still having a year left on his rookie contract and remaining injured.  This controversy exploded after the Colts owner Jim Irsay began tweeting at Taylor's agent, who began responding, with Taylor tweeting back and forth as well.  As of the beginning of the 2023 NFL Season, Taylor remains both unsigned to a second contract and on PUP (Physically Unable to Perform), and therefore not on the Colts 53-man roster.  The Colts initially explored trading Taylor, but were unable to come to a deal with any other team.  The Colts were rumored to have been asking for the equivalent of a first-round draft pick.</p>
		<h3>Staticsics</h3>
		<p>As of the beginning of the 2023 season, Jonathan Taylor has the following stastistics:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Rushing yards: 3841</li>
			<li>Rushing touchdowns: 33</li>
			<li>Receiving yards: 802</li>
