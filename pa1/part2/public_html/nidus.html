		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p id="text">Nidus is a Warframe added to the Warframe looter-shooter video game on December 22nd, 2016.  Although Nidus's origin is cloudy at best, one certainty is that he is a manifestion of "The Infestation," one of three enemy factions in Warframe.  Nidus is likely a Warframe corrupted by the infestation, due to his unique abilities to control the infestation.  After acquiring his blueprint from "The Glast Gambit" quest, Nidus requires grinding through many waves of the "Infested Salvage" game mode.  Nidus is the only Warframe to regnerate health without the usage of an ability or item.  Lastly, Nidus's abilities require building "stacks," which are roughly equivalent to absorbed energy from enemies.  Nidus can have up to 99 stacks at once.</p>
