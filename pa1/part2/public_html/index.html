		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p id="text">Excalibur is the cover character for the looter-shooter video game Warframe.  Excalibur's primary feature is a widely applicable ability set, average stats across the board without a severe weak spot, and easily recognizable character art.  Excalibur excels in close-quarters combat, particularly melee combat.  Excalibur is recognizable as the most humanoid of the Warframes, and designed around the original concept of a ninja.  Excalibur is one of three Warframes that can be chosen at the beginning of the game in the tutorial, along with Volt and Mag.</p>
